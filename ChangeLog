        (2003/08/25) PS1 - added check/missing.sh to supply missing
	"mktemp" command on Solaris.
	(2003/08/25) PS1 - new exit status 8 for non-fatal i/o

	to Simon Chung for help with the HP-UX port.
	(2003/08/13) JR1 - emacs support: provide jka-compr existence
	functions in jka-compr-ccrypt.el, to keep info.el happy.
	(2003/08/12) PS1 - CFLAGS are now set in ./configure and can be
	overridden - not that I recommend it.
	(2003/08/12) PS1 - new --with-lispdir=DIR configuration option
	(2003/06/16) PS1 - re-enabled --mismatch option which was
	inadvertently disabled when switching to ccryptlib in v1.3.  Also

	constants to compile under gcc-3.3.
	(2003/05/30) PS1 - changed scripts in "check" target to be
	independent of /dev/zero and put temporary files in /tmp.
	(2003/03/31) PS1 - changed rpm.spec file to be more Mandrake
	acceptable. Binaries will from now on be installed in /usr/bin,
	man pages in /usr/share/man.
	(2003/03/30) PS1 - fixed typo in usage message

v1.4 2003/03/29
	(2003/03/29) PS1 - added missing mode argument to open(2) calls.
	(2003/03/29) PS1 - made custom sigint handlers for overwrite and

	(2003/03/28) PS1 - added --tmpfiles option to use temporary files,
	rather than in-place update, when overwriting a file
	(2003/03/28) PS1 - removed a potential race condition for
	chown/chmod.

	(2003/03/28) PS1 - simplified logic in traverse.c:file_action(),
	and broke it into several functions.
	(2003/03/28) PS1 - eliminated perror(); included ccrypt program
	name in all error messages and warnings (except verbose messages
	and interactive prompts)
	(2003/03/28) PS1 - allow unixcrypt mode to decrypt symbolic links,
	and to use the -m option
	(2002/12/14) PS1 - added support for large (>2GB) files.
	(2002/12/14) PS1 - removed unnecessary "include"s from rijndael.c

v1.3 2002/09/26
	(2002/09/26) PS1 - added check/length-check.sh to the test suite
	and added some tests to check/ccrypt-check.sh. Fixed bug where
	some files were truncated on non-matching key.
	(2002/09/24) PS1 - allow to operate on write-protected files with
	user's permission, or if -f option is given.
	(2002/09/24) PS1 - fixed behavior on some errors; don't rename
	files or symlinks that could not be opened; don't rename hardlinks
	if encryption/decryption of their inode has failed.
	(2002/09/24) PS1 - added --strictsuffix option for refusing to
	encrypt files that already have a .cpt suffix.
	(2002/09/24) PS1 - added keychange test to check/ccrypt-check.sh.

	handling the second keyword in keychange mode.
	(2002/09/24) PS1 - linked ccryptlib into ccrypt sources and
	abandoned old character-based i/o interface. This speeds up ccrypt
	by about 20-30% (in file mode), 45-50% (in filter mode), and a
	breathtaking 85% in unix crypt mode.
	(2002/09/20) PS1 - started implementing ccryptlib, a buffer-based
	encryption/decryption library.
	(2002/08/22) PS1 - fixed bug #598800: result of xreadline
	unchecked in traverse.c:prompt.
	(2002/06/24) PS1 - renamed "no error" as "success".
	(2002/04/09) PS1 - changed RPMs to use symlinks, rather than hard
	links for ccdecrypt, ccencrypt, ccat.
	(2002/04/09) PS1 - changed autoconf script to determine 32-bit
	unsigned integer type at configure time.
	(2002/04/09) PS1 - changed --timid option to prompt for encryption
	keys twice even when operating as a filter.
	(2002/04/09) PS1 - made nonce generation more random by using
	microseconds, not just seconds, in the seed.

v1.2 2002/01/29
	(2002/01/28) PS1 - improved autoconf configuration in the case
	where getopt is present but getopt_long is missing
	(2002/01/22) PS1 - used profiling to make ccrypt about 55-65%
	faster by optimizing one critical inner loop.
        (2001/11/29) PS1 - updated man page to include new exit code 7.
	(2001/11/29) PS1 - fixed bug #486857 - replace == by = in
	{src,doc}/Makefile.am

v1.1 2001/11/28
	(2001/11/28) PS1 - added --timid option to prevent loss of data
	from accidentally mistyped keys. This option causes ccrypt to
	prompt twice for an encryption keys that will be used to update a
	file destructively. If the two entered keys are not equal, ccrypt
	will not proceed.
	(2001/11/27) PS1 - added autoconf magic for SunOS, FreeBSD, MacOS,
	AIX, and CygWin.
	(2001/11/27) PS1 - added optional replacements for getopt and/or
	crypt(3) libraries.
	(2001/11/26) PS1 - added check targets for testing correctness of
	binary
	(2001/11/26) PS1 - major reorganization of sources, added
	automake/autoconf configuration.
	(2001/11/24) PS1 - ensured that data is treated as binary under
	cygwin.
        (2001/11/24) PS1 - changed signal handler for Ctrl-C.
	(2001/11/24) PS1 - added --unixcrypt mode to simulate old unix
	style "crypt" program.
	(2001/11/24) PS1 - changed cat mode to operate as a filter when 0
	filenames are given.

v1.0 2001/10/30
	(2001/10/30) PS1 - created web page, created html man page,
	created RedHat rpms, upped version number to 1.0. First public
	release.
	(2001/10/30) PS1 - added signal handler for SIGINT. In overwrite
	mode, delay exit on SIGINT until after the current file is
	processed. Immediate exit can be forced by pressing SIGINT twice.
	(2001/10/27) PS1 - updated man page.
	(2001/10/27) PS1 - added exit code 5 for file format; this leaves
	4 for non-matching key, thus enabling emacs mode to re-prompt for
	the key.
	(2001/10/27) PS1 - added option --keyfile to read key from a
	file. "-" is a special case which replaces the old --pipekey
	option.
	(2001/10/27) PS1 - emacs support: pass keyword to ccrypt in
	environment variable, not on command line. Renamed package as
	jka-compr-ccrypt.el.
	(2001/10/27) PS1 - changed main.c to erase password from command
	line or environment (as displayed by "ps") immediately after
	copying it.
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - renamed -k option as -p
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - added -m option to allow decryption with
	mismatched key
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - added --license option and kept --version short
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - cleaned up concept of "modes" - now ccrypt is
	always in precisely one of -e, -d, -c, -x. In particular, cat mode
	is always decryption, since it does not make sense to concatenate
	encrypted data, and a pipeline can be used for a single file.
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - made a user interface for keychange feature -
	prompt for keys as appropriate etc. Note that there is currently
	no way to specify the second key on the command line or in an
	environment variable, or to specify a prompt for it.
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - changed implementation of --pipekey option to
	not read the key immediately, but after some checks.
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - converted to getopt()
	(2001/10/26) PS1 - changed cipher mode to Cipher Feedback (CFB) -
	this has the advantage that corrupted files may still be partially
	decrypted. Also, CFB is an ANSI standard mode with well-understood
	properties, which will encourage confidence in the security of the
	encryption provided. This is an incompatible change; thus,
	incrementing version number to 0.51 and magic cookie to c051.
	Note that this mode is identical to that provided by ccrypt0.5,
	except we omitted the 8-byte checksum at the end of the file.

date: 2001/10/27 05:27:31;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +98 -285
* ccrypt0.5, which was committed on 2001/02/13 without adequate log
message, was a version of ccrypt which used a checksum to suggest file
integrity. I since decided to discontinue this feature, since it is
not provably safe and might thus be misleading.
* the current commit is again called ccrypt0.4, because the file
format was reverted to format 0.4. All file format changing
features of 0.5 were reversed.
* changes relative to ccrypt0.4 as committed on 2000/11/30:
  * added Makefile as a dependency to some targets in Makefile
  * changed usage of "unsigned long" to word32 etc
  * changes to some comments and variable names in ccrypt.c
  * if in filemode and 0 filenames follow, don't prompt for password
  * updated todo file
  * exit immediately on i/o error, rather than continuing with the
    next file. This does not apply to non-existing files, but to
    errors on read/write.
  * added cypfaq01.txt to documentation
  * added emacs mode for ccrypt
* changes relative to ccrypt0.5 as committed on 2001/02/13:
  * undid version number change and magic string change
  * undid checksumming code
  * edited comments in emacs mode
----------------------------
date: 2001/02/27 03:46:12;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +10 -3

started re-vamping user interface. Renamed many command-line option to
be similar to those of gzip. All file-reading commands now operate on
multiple files. Explicit output file naming is no longer possible -
use filter mode for this.
The file-reading modes still need to be implemented.
----------------------------
date: 2000/05/16 03:44:30;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +64 -22

Fixed bug in ccrypt.c which scrambled state rather than state+8. This
changes encryption behavior, thus advanced to v0.2.

Fixed bug in guess_outfile, where ".cpt" was removed even if it was
not at the end of the infile name. (as in xxx.cpt2).

Threw out most of the code in main.c that dealt with files, temporary
files, renaming, checking for hard links, and all that. Instead, added
the ability to update a file in place by using read/write mode on it.

Also implemented the new OFB mode. Benchmarks yielded that if 32 state
bytes were used in the non-linear function that encodes each byte,
then the time spent in Rijndael and the time spent on calculating this
non-linear function would be about equal. This seems too much overhead
in return for the security of a single byte. Thus, I reduced the
number of state bytes used in this calculation to 9. This makes an
exhaustive search possible in the near future, but such a search is
probably not worth the effort, especially considering it only helps to
decrypt one byte, namely the first byte where a given ciphertext
differs from one with known plaintext.

Benchmark testing also showed that fseek is extremely expensive. The
original implementation of in-place update called fseek twice per
byte, which took 8 times more time that encryption itself. By using a
1000 byte buffer, I reduced this overhead to about 0.8%.

* Changed rijndael interface to operate on unsigned long arrays instead
  of char arrays - this ensures that the arrays are aligned properly on
  word boundaries.
* Also made many changes to the user interface. Now use "stat" to check
  inode of input and output file, test that they are regular files, and
  use (manual) copy, rather than rename, to copy the temporary file to
  the output (this overwrites all hardlink references).

Changes to file handling. ccrypt now checks for input/output errors,
and if such an error occurs, any partial output is deleted and the
original file retained. Also, in file mode, we now output to a
temporary file by default, since checking for identical filenames is
not sufficient to detect physical equality of input and output file.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/18 07:59:41;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +5 -41
Changed Makefile to run in directory rijndael recursively.
Linked sboxes into ccrypt rather than repeating them.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/17 17:44:36;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +81 -40
Updated ccrypt but it contains a bug: block cipher operates in
electronic dictionary mode. Also streamlined rijndael.c decryption,
and changed external interface to operate on strings rather than
2-dimensional arrays.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/16 17:58:39;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -1
Fixed array index bug in ccrypt.init_random. Also added fflush to main.
----------------------------

added "return 0" at end of main
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/14 08:50:27;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +10 -12
Improved hashing. It is now infeasible to find two passwords that hash
to the same key.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/14 08:41:50;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +22 -15
Changed password hashing to use rijndael instead of an ad hoc method.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/12 20:46:54;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +10 -14
removed arbitrary line length on password read from terminal (but
notice that Solaris still imposes 1024 character limit).
Added #ifdef lines to .h files.
Added Id tag to .in files.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/12 07:06:30;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +10 -6
fixed bug where OFB mode was not self-inverse. Also updated manpage
after reading more about block ciphers and modes.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/11 09:44:49;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +13 -13
Added GNU license to man page, and updated Makefile and main.c to
compile correctly on Solaris. Removed double global variable "key".
----------------------------

Complete rewrite of encryption algorithm based on Rijndael.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/10 01:36:19;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +163 -30
Added a man page, updated user interface, added config file and
install script.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/09 22:09:39;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +3 -108
Added Id headers, and separated ccrypt from main.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/09 21:40:20;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +26 -63
Created custom random number generator, both for portability and
because the GNU one is really bad. Also moved readkey to a separate
module.
----------------------------
date: 2000/04/09 06:30:21;  author: selinger;  state: Exp;  lines: +12 -6
Made it work with SUN rand() which produces 15-bit random integers.
----------------------------
