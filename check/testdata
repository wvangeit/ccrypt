Jakarta, Indonesia. Also earlier on Friday, rock-throwing and scuffles
broke out after 5,000 pro-Habibie supporters confronted an equal
number of anti-government student protesters who have been occupying
Parliament for most of the week. To cool tempers, the Indonesian
military employed a tactic not found in most military manuals -- about
100 of them marched in-between the two sides and began to sing and
dance. Stacking their assault weapons to the side, the soldiers
announced they were going to sing an old Javanese song called
``Goodbye My Love'' and urged the students to join in. As their
comrades clapped and sang along, 20 soldiers wearing camouflage and
bayonets high-stepped and strutted with a precision rivaling hip hop
dance routines.
